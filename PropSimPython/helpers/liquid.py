"""DesignLiquid Generates a liquid engine design matching the performance
specifications and constraints provided.
   Inputs:
       - goal.max_thrust: initial thrust required
       - goal.OF: OF ratio desired
       - goal.total_impulse: total impulse desired
       - goal.min_fuel_dp: minimum pressure drop from fuel tank to
       injector as proportion of fuel tank pressure
       - goal.min_ox_dp: minimum pressure drop from oxidizer tank to
       injector as proportion of oxidizer tank pressure
       - goal.ox_to_fuel_time: ratio of liquid oxidizer flow time to liquid fuel flow time
       - design.p_tanks: initial tank pressures
       - design.ox_ullage: initial oxidizer tank volume ullage fraction
       - design.exp_ratio: design expansion ratio
   Outputs:
       - inputs: engine design parameters (see PerformanceCode.m)
